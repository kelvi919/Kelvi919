# Hey thereðŸ‘‹, im Kelvi - aka [kelvi919]

In my spare time, I develop programs using Python and its modules as a hobby.
I am working on a variety of projects, as you can hopefully see in my repositories ;^).
If you want you can see all of my projects on my github profile and would appreciate any help you can provide. 
I can be reached via Discord Kelvi919#4698.
